<h1>Semantic<br/>Release<br/>Extra</h1>

CI/CD automation experiments driven by the ideas of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [semantic releases](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and monorepos.  
To build a better release workflow than we currently have. To save people's time. To enjoy.
