CI/CD automation experiments driven by the ideas of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [semantic releases](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and [monorepos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).  
To build better release workflows than we currently have.
