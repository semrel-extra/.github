<h1>Semantic<br/>Release</br>Extra</h1>

CI/CD automation experiments inspired by the ideas of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [semantic releases](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and monorepos.  
To build a better release experience than we currently have.  
To save people's time.  
To enjoy.
